# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill
levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who
wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code.
Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.
For more information see http://adventofcode.com/.

This repository contains my solutions, written in Erlang. Each folder contains
the Erlang file and the input file. It will use the input found in the input
file.
