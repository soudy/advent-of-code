# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill
levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who
wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code.
Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.
For more information see http://adventofcode.com/.

This repository contains my solutions, written in Erlang. Each folder contains
the Erlang script and the input file. The scripts should be interpreted using
`escript` (Erlang's interpreter). These scripts use the input file in their
directory by default, but can take a filename as first argument.
